# Introducing Robotics and the Arduino Ecosystem

## Additional notes

All code and procedures shown in the book were tested with the Arduino IDE v2.0.3.
When you install the IDE, you will likely get a newer version.
It is usually a good idea to always use the latest version of the Arduino IDE, 
and it is expected that all examples from this book will work with future versions of the IDE.
However, if you run into problems that you think might be caused by your version of the Arduino IDE (like ![this one](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/issues/1926) for example),
you can always download v2.0.3 ![here](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/releases/tag/2.0.3) and try if that resolves the problem.
